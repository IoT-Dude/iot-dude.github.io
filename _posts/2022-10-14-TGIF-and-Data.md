### TGI Fridays overview:
TGI Fridays is an American restaurant chain focusing on casual dining. Based in Texas, TGI Fridays is a key player in the hospitality industry with 5,000 employees and an annual revenue of $630,000.

The staff at TGI Fridays come from unusually diverse demographic backgrounds.
The company is 55.5% female and 36.9% ethnic minorities. Despite its diversity in other areas, TGI Fridays employees are noticeably lacking in political diversity.

TGI Fridays has great employee retention with staff members usually staying with the company for 3.4 years.
