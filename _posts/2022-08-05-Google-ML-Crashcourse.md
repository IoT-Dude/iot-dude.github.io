# Google ML Crashcourse

All in all, it is not a bad idea to pursue this course: This course is free and a good way to reign in various topics on has learned over the years in comp sci, math and engineering and shove it to AI- and machine learning land.

## Positive course design!
I would like to give a big thumbs up to the course creators and designers. The way they have structured the course is really commendable, as the course progresses on, one will notice the smooth flow of the course contents.
Each section of the course is completely modular. The flow of the content makes it easier to understand the sections when completed in order.

## Bonus
A bonus it that many concepts in the modules are linked to the advanced modules. So if someone is interested, one can choose to jump on that topic and come back again at a later stage.

## Structure
Starting with loss and gradient descent, then building through classification models and subsequently deep neural nets.
The smooth flow of the topics gave a good idea to the necessity of using deep neural nets when the datasets are not linear.

## Content
The course content is designed in such a way that each module has a combination of video lectures, playground exercises, text lessons and programming exercises. The video lectures are pretty short and informative. The text lessons mainly transcribe the video lessons. The playground exercises wast probably the best part of the course. The playground exercises where great plug and play exercises which help in visualizing the concepts in a profound mannerand the programming exercises were fun and informastive.

## Learning Outcome
I have studier some AI before, I have a interest and tinkered a bit but not really made anything of it. So it was fun to connect the course with statistics, linear algebra and other math topics; plus programing.

## Final verdict
A great online crash course with focus on the key concepts.
