# The Google Dataset Search ( Information wants to be free )

https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/

Google Dataset Search is a search engine from Google that helps researchers locate online data that is freely available for use.
When it was launched, Google stated that the product was targeted at scientists and data journalists - it complements Google Scholar, a search engine for academic studies and reports.


Q: Just another search engine?
A: Noop, it is a big one!!!

-stop destination for researchers in the field of artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning, data mining and many others.
And it is a big one!


As a freelance data analyst (IBM Data Science Professional)
For AI and ML algorithms to work and predict accurate results, we need to feed them with data. The larger the amount of data, the better is the result.

But the big question is where to get the data from?
In a project i now work on i am in desperate need for useful datasets to use for accurate results, and it is difficult to find datasets with usefull dgdunits.

It is out there
There is usefull resources to use for data scientists and AI researchers that looks for datasets. But they were usually scattered, difficult to find and often a tedious process. The popular sources were search repositories such as UCI Machine Learning where most of the datasets were uploaded, Github, Kaggle or simply scrolling through various links on Reddit(yes, desperation is desperation...).

Otherwise it is down to domainwise searches like data related to climate, Railroad Companys and banks or looking into specific websites such as UN, NASAor World Bank.


With the growing popularity in the area of AI and ML, Google now has a working search engine that aims to help researchers and data scientists to have a quick and easy access to data which otherwise is difficult without a network of professional connections.

Vacuum want to be filled? How does it work?

Individuals, institutions or organisations who wish to publish their data online need to include metadata tags in their web pages. Like description of that data, , project names, names of the creators, date of publishing, terms of usage, the source of data collected etc. This information is then indexed by Google Dataset Search. The aim is to make data easy discoverable while keeping it where it is. 

Google has made a specific set of guidelines for the users to follow, which makes it easy and convenient to understand the content of their pages. Google encourages dataset providers, large and small to adopt this common standard so that all datasets are a part of this robust ecosystem.  


What I like so far:
It is the only dataset search engine so far. It seems to be a one stop solution for all data needs. Google Dataset Search sources and locates all data that is freely available. 

Promote Open Data Culture - it brings free data together. It contributes towards the open data movement.
 It is helpful for both beginners trying to learn algorithms or advanced researchers working on a new AI.
 

But one drawbackcouild be that datasets sometimes is uploaded with less or obsolete descriptions - it is sometimes hard to locate - And then one starts to question the quality of it.

All in all Google Dataset Search is a brilljant application by Google and it will probably be useful for the research community.
