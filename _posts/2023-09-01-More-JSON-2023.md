# Difficulties reading very large JSON-files 


Q: How to open very large JSON files?

JSON is the most used format to store data, and mostly, there were only text editors to handle it, and they are not the real proper solution as they will quickly lose effect and speed as the file size grows.

My computer just boggs down and CPU getting hot

Whenever I work with a new BIG JSON-file, I face this issue again and again. I canâ€™t open them properly!


How to?

I need a a linux tool that views the JSON as JSON, not as text to find how object and arrays are shaped

Added to that, it has to be a fast JSON parser that just works
