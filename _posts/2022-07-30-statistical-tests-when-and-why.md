For a person being from a non-statistical background the most confusing aspect of statistics, are always the fundamental statistical tests, and when to use which. This is an attempt to mark out the difference between the most common tests, the use of null value hypothesisin these tests and outlining the conditions under which a particular test should be used.

Null: Given two sample means are equal

Alternate: Given two sample means are not equal
