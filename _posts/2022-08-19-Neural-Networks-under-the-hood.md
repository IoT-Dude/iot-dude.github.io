# Neural Networks under the hood


Neural Networks, deep learning etc ...

Deep neural networks, it is quite challenging to understand what a neural network is really doing. If one trains it well, it achieves high quality results, but it is challenging to make it worl, to understand why it is doing what it is doing. If the network fails, it is hard to understand what went wrong.

I have found a good blog post that i would like to recommend: ![Olahs blog](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/)
