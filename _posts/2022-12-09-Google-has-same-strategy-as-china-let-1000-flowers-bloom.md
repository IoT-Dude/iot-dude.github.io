### Googles company strategy - Let 1000 flowers bloom
The piece is about how Google has a company strategy, but they don’t make product strategies.

Google acts like a typical venture capitalist, investing in promising people with the expectation that most will fail. They invest broadly in search of the idea that will deliver 100x. Let 1000 flowers bloom, and see which are the best.

### The lack of a product strategy is the way to go
The lack of a product strategy is behind many of Googles shortlived products, projects like Google Wave and Stadia. Instead of a wellstructured and thoroughly reviewed plan for how to succeed the projects has a OK: Go Launch! without a deep plan for how to succeed.


I havn’t really until now realized that the product strategy is way more important and influential of the outcome than having a company strategy.
Because it’s the products that have an impact on peoples lives, not the company. As a consumer it is the products we use that is important and not the company.

### The way forward: Fail fast and release often.
Fail fast and release often is probably a good strategy to  create a successfull product. It is the product that have the potential to be the silver bullit in a company - not the company in itself.

But it is a bit sad to see all the products that has been [axed in the name of good financial progress](https://killedbygoogle.com/)
