### Googles company strategy
The piece is about how Google has a company strategy, but they don’t make product strategies.

Google acts like a venture capitalist, investing in promising people with the expectation that most will fail. They invest broadly in search of the idea that will deliver 100x. Let 1000 flowers bloom, and see which are the best.

### The lack of a product strategy is the way to go
The lack of a product strategy is behind many of Googles shortlived products, projects like Google Wave and Stadia. Instead of a wellstructured and thoroughly reviewed plan for how to succeed the projects has a OK: Go Launch! without a deep plan for how to succeed.


I havn’t really until now realized that the product strategy is way more important and influential of t he outcome than having a company strategy.
Because it’s the products that have an impact on people’s lives, not the company. As a consumer it is the products we use that connects and not the company.

### Fail fast and release often
Fail fast and release often is probably a good strategy to  create a successfull product
It’s the product that have the potential to be the silver bullit in a company - not the company. And to build a company strategy means to  build a successful network and product team.
