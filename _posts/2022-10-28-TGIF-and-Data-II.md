## Applied Observability and Phasing out of Social Media Data   2
Two things that stands out for me are the keyword Applied Observability and the prediction of marketing phasing out the use of social media individual data.

### Applied Observability - from reacting to proactive meassures.
The path to data-driven decision making includes a shift from monitoring and reacting to data to proactively applying that data in an orchestrated and integrated way across the enterprise.
Doing so can shorten the time it takes to reach critical decisions while also facilitating faster, more accurate planning.
Gartner notes observable data as an organization's "most precious monetizable asset" and encourages leaders to seek use cases and business capabilities in which this data can deliver competitive advantage.

### Phasing out of individual data (taken from social media) has less to say today.
Gartner predicts a phasing out of marketing that uses social media sites data about individuals, but how will that change, and now adays when adaptive to AI can change after being deployed beig in use of organizations?


### Case study TGI Fridays
As an example - lets have a look at TGI Fridays which uses location services to provide value for its franchise partners

First a TGI Fridays Overview:
TGI Fridays is an American restaurant chain focusing on casual dining. Based in Texas, TGI Fridays is a key player in the hospitality industry with 5,000 employees and an annual revenue of $630,000.

The staff at TGI Fridays come from unusually diverse demographic backgrounds.
The company is 55.5% female and 36.9% ethnic minorities. Despite its diversity in other areas, TGI Fridays employees are noticeably lacking in political diversity.
TGI Fridays has great employee retention with staff members usually staying with the company for 3.4 years.


### Source of advantage, location data - future outlook
Location data as a source of advantage
TGI Fridays is one such restaurant chain that has learned to use location intelligence to its advantage. They have learned to harnessing the power of location data, as well as the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Location data has become a valuable resource for restaurants looking to target potential customers in specific areas. This data can provide analytics and attribution for marketing strategies, with opportunities to drive performance on a more granular level.

### Location data is important for a business like TGI Fridays
In the past year, They have incorporated a larger percentage of the budget into social media marketing, and location data has been a real game changer.
In a franchise system, your franchisees are always trying to figure out how the brands spending affects their restaurant directly. Social location data can demonstrate how the money works more efficiently at a local level.


### Some of the practices in place
When analyzing a target within a 10-25 KM (6-15 mile) radius around the restaurants, useing location intelligence to create detailed personas for ad targeting. It is helpfull to identify look alike audiences (similar restaurants etc) and target competitive customers who may be dining at nearby locations.

This is very helpful for daily strategy. For example, a restaurant in a suburban area may not have a great lunch business. And with look alike data, it is easy to understand and then expand the modelingt. One can expand  and go beyond casual dining users to people who use QSRs [quick-service restaurants], which is more common at lunchtime in some areas. This is especially effective when getting into granular levels, like lunch, dinner or happy hour.


### Outside social data, what are some other ways marketers are utilizing location data?
It is beginning to get difficult to discover how go where the customers are. Both Apple and Google have made location data opt-outs more prominent on their respective smartphone operating systems. These changes along with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) has affected  ability to do this kind of targeting.

Privacy and user compliance have begun to limit the sources, and therefore the availability of the mobile location data points. As a result, the price for quality source data is increasing. But as the concerns tie into the quality of the data, you always want the best quality. It is affecting the pricing.

### Will there always be quality data out there, but expensive and harder to seek out?
Ethically sourced data is most likely going to come at an increased premium. But as a marketer, having that quality data is of utmost concern; that is the data we need in order to be strategic and see results.


###Consumer privacy is always a concern.
Advertisers need to be very careful in deciding when and where to utilize location data points. But still, despite privacy concerns, the question is if consumers in the future be willing to share their location data if there is a clear benefit to them. 
Consumers are aware of value proposition, and when data collection is done right, it is done with explicit consumer consent.
That is a signal that they are open to this type of marketing. 

Going back to Gartners report of future  predictions for strategic tech trends in the coming year - how else can marketers strive to deliver on the value proposition?

### Increased accuracy is important.
In an organization there is plenty of data, and being smart about how to use it helps how to place it is of the uttermost priority. the data is the organizations most precious monetizable asset and to understand what data you are going to take in and how to refine it, that is where the challenge for analysts and marketers exists.

As stated earlier in this article Applied Observability - from reacting to proactive meassures - will be more important in the future. From monitoring and reacting to data to proactively applying that data in an orchestrated and integrated way across the enterprise for decision making.
