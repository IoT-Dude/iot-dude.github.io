# Using scikit learn as a work strategy

Nothing wrong with djdjd but why not use something with less things to tweak
Why use the latest?


## So much to learn and so little time for knowledge
Much is happening in dataanalytics and AI (Artificial Intelligence), the same goes for ML (Machine Learning).
So much to learn and so little time for knowledge - it is time to chose how to interact with all new technologies, Google vvv, ChatAPT etc..

### This is my strategy
I am gonna focus on ML and Scikit-learn, more of a statistic approach instead of a huge-big-blob-funny-generating-pictures-AI-model.


### Machine Learning
Scikit-learn, (also known as sklearn), is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.



## Scikit-learn vs Tensorflow â€“ When to use What?

scikit learn vs tensorflow	

For data-/ and machine learning scientists, it is very important to understand the difference such that they could use these libraries appropriately while working on different business use cases. 

## When to use Scikit-learn?
Scikit-learn is a great entry point for beginners data scientists. It provides an efficient implementation of many machine learning algorithms. In addition, it is very simple and easy to use. You can get started with Scikit-learn in a very easy manner by using Jupyter notebook. Scikit-learn can be used to solve different kinds of machine learning problems including some of the following:

Classification (SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression, etc)
Regression (SVR, nearest neighbors, random forest, etc)
Clustering (K-means, spectral clustering, etc)
Model selection (grid search, cross-validation, metrics etc)
Dimensionality reduction (K-means, feature selection, etc)

Scikit-learn mainly works with tabular data.


## When to use Tensorflow?
Tensorflow, on the other hand, makes it possible to train and run very large neural networks efficiently based on deep learning algorithms by distributing the computations across potentially thousands of multi-GPU servers. It is a more complex library for distributed numerical computation using data flow graphs. Simply speaking, Tensorflow is a low-level library that is used for deep learning models, unlike scikit-learn which can be considered as the high-level library used to train classical machine learning models.

Tensorflow works with a variety of data such as tabular, text, images, audio, and video.
