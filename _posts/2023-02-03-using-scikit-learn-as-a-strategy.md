# Using scikit learn as a work strategy

<i><b>So much to learn and so little time for knowledge - instead i will focus on the "classical" ML statistic side of things, and in time find currage to swim on the deep side of the pool.</b></i><br><br>
Much is happening in dataanalytics and AI (Artificial Intelligence), the same goes for ML (Machine Learning).
So much to learn and so little time for knowledge - it is time to chose how to interact with all new technologies like [Google Bard](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)


### This is my strategy
I am gonna focus on ML and Scikit-learn, more of a statistic approach, instead of a huge-big-blob-funny-generating-pictures-AI-model.
<br>
Part of reason to not focus on deep learning jusr now is due to time constraint - it takes time to learn new API:s and language models, and I am a slow learner.

### Machine Learning
Scikit-learn, (also known as sklearn), is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.



## Scikit-learn vs Tensorflow â€“ When to use What?

From the perspective of a data analysis and machine learning scientists, there is a difference between Scikit-learn and Tensorflow libraries, they overlap a bit in various fields but as analytical tools they are used for different tasks and environments. 

## When to use Scikit-learn?
Scikit-learn is a great machine learning library to use with python in statistical modeling for data scientists - it provides an efficient implementation of many machine learning algorithms. In addition, it is very simple to use  with Jupyter notebook. 
<br>
Scikit-learn can be used to solve different kinds of machine learning problems including some of the following:
- Classification (SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression, etc)
- Regression (SVR, nearest neighbors, random forest, etc)
- Clustering (K-means, spectral clustering, etc)
- Model selection (grid search, cross-validation, metrics etc)
- Dimensionality reduction (K-means, feature selection, etc)

<b>Scikit-learn mainly works with tabular data</b>


## When to use Tensorflow?
Tensorflow, on the other hand, makes it possible to train and run very large neural networks, efficiently based on deep learning algorithms by distributing the computations across potentially thousands of multi-GPU servers. 
It is a big complex library for distributed numerical computation using data flow graphs. 


In short, Tensorflow is a low-level library that is used for deep learning models, compared to scikit-learn which can be considered as the high-level library used to train classical machine learning models.

Tensorflow works with a variety of data such as tabular, text, images, audio, and video.


## Conclusion
I am probably a more statistical oriented analyst and thus prefer to work with scikit-learn. For now that will be my focus, but who knows, there is much interesting stuff happening right now!
