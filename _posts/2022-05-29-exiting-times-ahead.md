# Exiting Times ahead - dark skies for the Swedish tech-sector

Is this the the Dotcom Bubble 2.0?

Just recently swedish Klarna laid off 700 employees world wide - 10 percent. But the problem is much bigger than Klarna. It looks dark for the Swedish tech sector.

The stock market has fallen 20 percent since the start of 2022 and the worst performer is the recently high-flying tech sector.
The price falls in many companies are reminiscent of the slaughter when the dotcom bubble burst in the beginning of 2000.
It is obvious that the market is not repeating itself, but it is similar.

Particularly hard hit - both now and last time year 2000 - are the tech companies that are not yet making any money.

The market leading bank Goldman Sachs has an index of tech companies that do not generate profits and this has plummeted by two thirds since the price record in November 2021.

## Burn-rate to survive
These companies strategy has largely been based on an somewhat updated version of the 1999 investment model. You fill it with as much money as one has to burn off to survive, and become the big survivor one on the market.

A good example is the swedish music service Spotify. It has really be counted among the loss-making companies as the result ended up close to zero last year.

Still, the stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has collapsed. The price is now 70 percent lower than at the peak in November and 25 percent lower than when the company was listed in April 2018.

The fall of Spotify is not so much based on cracked illusions of a future market as the more profane realization that not much grows forever. And it is becoming increasingly difficult for streaming services such as Spotify to keep costs down if you want to stay on the market.

The film service Netflix report, the first quarter of 2022, was a big bucket of ice water for the streaming companies. Netflix showed for the first time
a declining number of subscribers and the loss of those who have been customers for more than three years was particularly large. The Netflix share plummeted by 40 percent on the report and is now down 73 percent since the peak in November.

## Predatory payment solutions for e-commerce is down the drain
But it has been even worse for companies that lose money. The competitor to Swedish Klarna, American Affirm, has lost 86 percent of its value since the peak last autumn and 76 percent since its introduction on Nasdaq in January last year. Affirms business model is reminiscent of Klarnas. Affirm also provides predatory payment solutions for e-commerce and makes money from customers who shop online and choose the option  to pay later when they check out of the web shop. Affirm talso takes a commission from the merchants who are connected to the payment platform.

And like Klarna, Affirm has invested heavily to grow in this market. That is, they have a high burn rate. Last year, while Affirm had revenues of $870 million, it also reported a loss of $433 million.

At first glance, Klarna looks slightly healthier. The Groups revenues were around 50 percent higher than Affirm for 2021. And the front page of the Klarna report for  first quarter of this year states that the company net operating income increased by 20 percent from $320 million to 361 million dollar. 
However, if you look further in the report, a different picture emerges. The profit during the quarter will instead be a loss of more than SEK 2.5 billion if you include credit losses.

## Burn-rate is no longer an asset
The realization that the burn rate is no longer an asset in the tech sector has made Klarna now say it wants to focus on shortterm profitability. As part of this, 10 percent of the staff, 700 people, were fired.

Sobriety in terms of growth and cost control is now spreading rapidly to other parts of the tech sector as well. The other day, for example, the digital health center Kry announced that it was getting rid of 100 people, corresponding to 10 percent of the staff at the head office.

Exiting times ahead.
