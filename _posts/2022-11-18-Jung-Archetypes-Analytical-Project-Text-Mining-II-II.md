# Text Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn

In the progress to build a text classification tool (filter) for my Jung Archetypes Analytical Projet I need to build context for my own understanding as well as for others understanding  of how it works. 

Text classification is one of the most commonly used NLP tasks. This is an example of <b>sentimental analysis</b> of movie reviews, a common text classification task being performed using Python, Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas etc.

### Machine Learning
[Scikit-learn, (also known as sklearn)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-learn), is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
