# Jungs psychological analysis toolkit: archetypes

The psychologist Carl Jung theorized that humans use symbols and symbolism for a more easily understanding of complex concepts - for description and understanding. As a result of his research, he noted: “There are forms or images of a collective nature which occur practically all over the earth as constituents of myths and at the same time, as individual products of unconscious.” (Psychology of the Unconscious, C. G. Jung, Courier Corporation, 2012).

Jung called these ("forms or images of a collective nature"), ("constituents of myths") and ("individual products of unconscious.”) archetypes.

Imprinted and hardwired
<br>
These archetypes are imprinted and hardwired into our psyches, in his work, Jung theorized that over the course of all time, certain paths to greater understanding for people remain both recognizable and timeless. And that these paths to greater understanding should be categorized. Further, that these categories exhibit personality traits that are easily understood.

Archetypes can be quantified
<br>
Archetypes, personality traits and cathegories can be quantified, and when properly identified archetypes will correlate and align with a certain personality type with a specific persona (in the advertising industry it is called brand identity).

### Hypothesis: having enough data and crunching power one can make an inference engine useful in social dynamic environments.
<br>
As it could be applied to a brand, the idea of archetypes is fairly universal and may be effective also as a tool also for other knowledge actors working with leads trying to focus the knowledge effort(such as academia etc).
This hypothesis is a proposition made as a basis for reasoning, without any assumption of truth, a supposition made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.


To start with, in Jungs psychological analysis toolkit there are twelve basic archetypes:
<br>
The Innocent
<br>
The Everyman
<br>
The Hero
<br>
The Outlaw
<br>
The Explorer
<br>
The Creator
<br>
The Ruler
<br>
The Magician
<br>
The Lover
<br>
The Caregiver
<br>
The Jester
<br>
The Sage


In my next post I will put down some short notes on each of them
