### NumPy Intro

This material is Copylefted from 2020 Google LLC Machine Learning Crash Course(but quite good so I am using it). 


## NumPy
NumPy is a Python library for creating and manipulating vectors and matrices.
This  is not an exhaustive tutorial on NumPy, rather, just enough to use NumPy.


## Import NumPy module

Run the following code cell to import the NumPy module:

import numpy as np 


v1.2
